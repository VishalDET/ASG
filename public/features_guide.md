## 💡 Best Practices
- **Daily Engagement**: Encourage customers to visit the portal every day to scratch their card.
- **Validation**: Always use the "Redemption Terminal" before giving the discount to ensure the code hasn't been used before.
- **Analytics**: Check the "Conversion Funnel" in Analytics to see which offers are most popular.
